    "If you are working with basic NLP techniques like BOW, Count Vectorizer or TF-IDF(Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency) then removing stopwords is a good idea because stopwords act like noise for these methods. If you working with LSTM’s or other models which capture the semantic meaning and the meaning of a word depends on the context of the previous text, then it becomes important not to remove stopwords.\n",

    "\"I dont like this product\" - Negative. If we remove stopwords, it becomes \"Like project\"- Positive. Hence It always better to use LSTM in as many cases as possible\n",
